# Lex Chatbot Web Interface

> Sample Lex Chatbot Web Interface Application

## Overview
This application provides a sample chatbot web interface for [Amazon
Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/). It is a responsive user interface that
can be run as a mobile friendly stand-alone web app or embedded into an
existing site using an iframe. The interface supports interacting with
Lex using text and voice.

## Application Architecture
The chatbot interface is a JavaScript driven web application.
It works by making calls to the Lex service directly from a
user's browser using temporary credentials obtained from [Amazon
Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). This allows the chatbot web app
to be served from S3 or CloudFront in a scalable serverless architecture.
Here is a diagram of how the application works:

### Dependencies
The chatbot web app is built using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
JavaScript framework. The user interface is structured as modular
components using [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com/). The application
state management is done using [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/). The
code base employs ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features such as modules, arrow
functions and classes to improve modularity and brevity.

### Library
The chatbot UI provides a library that can be used as a Vue plugin.
It adds a property named `$lexWebUi` to the Vue class and registers
a global Vue component name `LexWebUi`.

You can import the library as a module and use it in your code:
```JavaScript
  // dependencies
  import Vue from 'vue';
  import Vuex from 'vuex';
  import Vuetify from 'vuetify';

  // import the component constructor
  import { Loader as LexWebUi } from 'aws-lex-web-ui';

  Vue.use(Vuetify);
  Vue.use(Vuex);

  // plugin creates the LexWebUi component
  const lexWebUi = new LexWebUi({
    // pass your own configuration
    cognito: {
      poolId: 'us-east-1:deadbeef-fade-babe-cafe-0123456789ab',
    },
    lex: {
      initialText: 'How can I help you?',
      botName: 'helpBot',
    },
    ui: {
      toolbarTitle: 'Help Bot',
      toolbarLogo: '',
    },
  });

  // instantiate Vue
  const vm = new Vue({
    el: '#lex-web-ui',
    // vuex store is in the lexWebUi instance
    store: lexWebUi.store,
    // you can use the global LexWebUi/<lex-web-ui> commponent in templates
    template: `
      <div id="lex-web-ui-app">
        <lex-web-ui
          v-on:updateLexState="onUpdateLexState"
        ></lex-web-ui>
      </div>`,
    methods: {
      onUpdateLexState(lexState) {
        // handle lex state change events
      },
    },
  });

  /*
  You will need to import the CSS depdendencies as well:

    @import 'node_modules/roboto-fontface/css/roboto/roboto-fontface.css';
    @import 'node_modules/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css';
    @import 'node_modules/vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css';
    @import 'node_modules/aws-lex-web-ui/dist/lex-web-ui.css';
  */
```

Alternatively, for finer control, you can use the Vue plugin directly
in your application:
```JavaScript
  import Vue from 'vue';
  import Vuex from 'vuex';
  import Vuetify from 'vuetify';
  import { Config as AWSConfig, CognitoIdentityCredentials }
    from 'aws-sdk/global';
  import LexRuntime from 'aws-sdk/clients/lexruntime';
  import Polly from 'aws-sdk/clients/polly';

  import { Plugin as LexWebUi, Store as LexWebUiStore } from 'aws-lex-web-ui';

  Vue.use(Vuex);
  Vue.use(Vuetify);

  const poolId = 'us-east-1:deadbeef-cac0-babe-abcd-abcdef01234';
  const region = 'us-east-1';
  const credentials = new CognitoIdentityCredentials(
    { IdentityPoolId: poolId },
    { region },
  );
  const awsConfig = new AWSConfig({ region, credentials });
  const lexRuntimeClient = new LexRuntime(awsConfig);
  const pollyClient = new Polly(awsConfig);

  const store = new Vuex.Store(LexWebUiStore);

  // see the configuration section for details about the config fields
  const config = {
    cognito: { poolId },
    lex: { botName: 'MyBot', initialText: 'How can I help you?' },
    ui: { toolbarLogo: '', toolbarTitle: 'My Bot' },
  };

  Vue.use(LexWebUi, { config, awsConfig, lexRuntimeClient, pollyClient });

  /*
    You can now use the '<lex-web-ui>' tag in your Vue templates The
    'LexWebUi' component is global to the Vue instance. You can access
    the lexWebUi plugin instance in your components as 'this.$lexWebUi'.

    Make sure to add the 'store' variable as the vuex store to your Vue
    instance or component.

    The '<lex-web-ui>' component emits 'updateLexState' events everytime
    the Lex state changes. The parent component can handle these events
    using 'v-on' to grab the current Lex state.

    You will need to import CSS dependencies into your project:
    @import 'node_modules/roboto-fontface/css/roboto/roboto-fontface.css';
    @import 'node_modules/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css';
    @import 'node_modules/vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css';
    @import 'node_modules/aws-lex-web-ui/dist/lex-web-ui.css';
  */
```

## Credential Management
This sample application uses [Amazon
Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to provide temporary AWS
credentials for use with the Lex and Polly services.

The accompanying CloudFormation stack in this project, automatically
creates a
[Cognito Identity Pool](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html)
for you. If you want to manually use your own Cognito Identity Pool,
you will need to link a role to it. The associated role should
allow access to the Lex PostText/PostContent API calls and Polly
SynthesizeSpeech.

## Voice Support
Users can interact with the bot using voice on compatible browsers.
The application uses the
[getUserMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)
call from the
[WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
API to record the voice interaction from the browser.

The audio recorder (based on
[Recorderjs](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs)
is implemented using the
[Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
API to detect silence and to process the audio. Processing supports
optional frequency filtering around the human voice to reduce noise.
It automatically encodes the sound in PCM WAV file format using a
[Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
The web worker also resamples the audio and optionally trims silence in
the beginning and end of the recording to make the sound files smaller
and to achieve faster network transfers.

The encoded sound is automatically passed to the Lex service. In turn,
Lex performs automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language
understanding (NLU), transcription and bot processing.

The voice interaction has been tested with recent versions of Chrome
and Firefox on both PC and Mac desktops plus Microsoft Edge on PCs. It
is also compatible with Android devices using Chrome and FireOS Tablets
using Silk. Voice is not supported on Safari or any browser on iOS
devices.

NOTE: browsers may require the application to be served using HTTPS for
the WebRTC API to work. Make sure to serve the application from an HTTPS
enabled server or if hosting on S3 or CloudFront, use https in the URL.

## Configuration and Customization
The chatbot UI requires configuration parameters pointing to external
resources such as the Lex bot name and the Cognito Identity Pool Id
(this repo includes CloudFormation templates to create these Cognito and
Lex resources). Additionally, you may want to pass parameters to change
the default run time configuration (e.g. look and feel).

This configuration can come the sources listed below (by order of
precedence where the latter overrides the previous).

1. Default Configuration Object
2. Build Time Configuration
3. Run Time Configuration
    1. URL Parameter
    2. Loader Config

See the sections below for details about each one.

### Default Configuration Object
The base configuration comes from the `configDefault` object in the
[src/config/index.js](src/config/index.js) script. This script controls
customizable UI looks (e.g. colors, titles), behavior (e.g. recorder
settings) and runtime parameters (e.g. Lex bot name). It exports an
object that is the source of all available configurable options that
the chatbot UI recognizes and their initial values.

**NOTE**: To avoid having to manually merge future changes, you probably
do not want to modify the values in the `src/config/index.js` file. You
should instead pass your own configuration using the mechanisms listed
in the following sections.

### Build Time Configuration
The chatbot UI build process can import configuration from a JSON
file. This is done when [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) bundles
the chatbot UI files (normally done using `npm run build`).

This JSON config file should contain the the same key/value structure
as the `configDefault` object in the `src/config/index.js` file. Its
content is merged with the values of `configDefault` overriding the
initial values.

The JSON config files reside under the `src/config` directory. They
follow the naming convention: `config.<ENV>.json` where `<ENV>`
depends on the on the environment type as determined by the `NODE_ENV`
environmental variable (e.g. development, production). This allows to
pass a configuration that is specific to the specific build or runtime
environment. The files follow this directory structure:

```
.
|__ src
   |__ config
      |__ config.dev.json   # local development config
      |__ config.prod.json  # production config
      |__ config.test.json  # testing config
```

Here's an example of the `config.dev.json` file:

```
{
  "cognito": {
    "poolId": "us-east-1:deadbeef-cac0-babe-abcd-abcdef01234",
  },
  "lex": {
    "bot": "MyLexBotName",
    ...
  },
  "ui": {
    "parentOrigin": "http://localhost:8080",
    ...
  }
}
```

**NOTE**: The CloudFormation templates included in this repo create
a pipeline that uses CodeBuild. The CloudFormation stack created by
these templates passes various parameters as environmental variables to
CodeBuild. These environmental variables are used by CodeBuild to populate
values in the JSON files described above. For example, when the stack
creates a Cognito Pool Id, the Pool Id is passed to CodeBuild which in
turn modifies the JSON files described above. Please take into account
that CodeBuild may override the values in your files at build time.

### Run Time Configuration
The chatbot UI can be passed dynamic configuration at run time. This allows
to override the default and build time configuration.

#### URL Parameter
The chatbot UI configuration can be initialized using the `lexWebUiConfig` URL
parameter. This is mainly geared to be used in the stand-alone mode of
the chatbot UI (not iframe).

The `lexWebUiConfig` URL parameter should follow the same JSON structure of the
`configDefault` object in the `src/config/index.js` file. This parameter
should be a JSON serialized and URL encoded JavaScript object. Values
from this parameter override the ones from the environment config files.

For example to change the initialText config field, you can use a URL
like this:

`https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#/?lexWebUiconfig=%7B%22lex%22%3A%7B%22initialText%22%3A%22Ask%20me%20a%20question%22%7D%7D`

You can encode the `lexWebUiConfig` URL parameter like this:
```javascript
var lexWebUiConfig = JSON.stringify({
  lex: {
    initialText: 'Ask me a question',
  }
});

var query = 'lexWebUiConfig=' + encodeURIComponent(lexWebUiConfig);
var url = 'https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#/?' + query;
var lexWebUiWindow = window.open(url, 'Lex Web UI', 'width=400', 'height=500');
```

#### Loader Config
This project provides a separate library used to load the component in
an existing web page. The loader library supports various mechanisms
used to pass the config dynamically. See the [ChatBot UI Configuration
Loading](/src/README.md#chatbot-ui-configuration-loading) section of
the loader documentation for details.

### Playback Options
The voice responses from the Lex `postContent` API calls are automatically
played back. The chatbot UI provides options to control the playback.
For example, you can allow to interrupt the playback of long responses and
fine tune the various values associated with interruptions:

```
...
lex: {

  // allow to interrupt playback of lex responses by talking over playback
  enablePlaybackInterrupt: true,

  // microphone volume level to cause an interrupt
  // lower values makes interrupt more likely
  playbackInterruptVolumeThreshold: -60,

  // only allow to interrupt playback longer than this value (in seconds)
  playbackInterruptMinDuration: 3,
}
...
```

### Logos
You can change the default logo and favorite icon images by placing
your own images in `src/assets/logo.(png|jge?g|svg)` and
`src/assets/favicon.(png|jpe?g|svg|ico)`
respectively. The favorite icon is set to the logo image if the
`src/assets/favicon.*` file is not found.

Alternatively, you can set the `ui.toolbarLogo` and `ui.favIcon` fields
in the config files to an image URL.

### Lex Session Attributes
The Lex service supports
[session attributes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt.html#context-mgmt-session-attribs)
as a way to pass application context to a bot or to share information
accross intents. This chatbot UI passes the `sessionAttributes` parameter
to the Lex API and automatically updates it from the bot responses.

The `sessionAttributes` parameter can be initialized so that the client
passes a value in the first request.

### Response Cards
The chatbot UI supports Lex
[Response Cards](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/ex-resp-card.html).
For Lex `postText` API calls, response cards are supported natively.
When using the `postContent` API call, response cards can be passed
using session attributes in the `appContext.responseCard` key of the
`sessionAttributes` object. For example, the following python snippet
can be used in a Lambda code hook to add a responseCard in a postContent
API call:

```python
response['sessionAttributes']['appContext'] =
    json.dumps({'responseCard': response_card})
```

**NOTE:** Since session attributes are persisted between requests. You
might need to clear the resposeCard field on incoming events being passed
again by the client.

For details about the response cards format,
see the
[ResponseCard documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_ResponseCard.html).

## Dependencies and Build Setup
The application dependencies are managed using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). The build artifacts are bundled using
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Initial scaffolding of this project
was done with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the
